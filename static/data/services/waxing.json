					"We specialize in a range of men&apos;s and women&apos;s waxing for body and face. Our pine-based, proprietary elastic-wax formula is created with pure, honest ingredients for optimal comfort even on the most sensitive skin. Applied at body temperature, it exfoliates and nourishes, while its flexible elasticity adheres directly to the hair, leaving only smooth skin behind. It is made in Australia, gluten-free, all-natural, and vegan. Three different wax formulas are available, and can be used alone or in combination during your service based on your individual skin and hair type."
