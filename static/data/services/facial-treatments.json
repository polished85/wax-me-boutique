The facial uses our proprietary customized and infused medical ingredients to target specific conditions like hyperpigmentation, oily skin, anti-aging, breakouts, dry skin, and more. The Nano-Needling Facial is non-invasive and causes no pain. It is a cosmetic facial, not a medical procedure. Numbing cream is not needed for the facial."

This light energy improves cellular health by accelerating the repair and replenishment of compromised tissue cells. It is anti-aging, proven to increase collagen and elastin, softening lines and repairing damaged tissue. Effective to treat and heal acne, as blue light diminishes bacteria and inflammation. Recommended for acne prone skin and mature skin."

Microcurrent increases cellular energy (ATPs) which leads to healthy new cells and an increase of collagen and elastin synthesis. First designed for Bell's Palsy patients to retrain their muscles, it is currently used in treating sports injuries to accelerate the healing process due to the increase of collagen. It is widely used in the world of Esthetics for an instant non-surgical facelift, making it extremely popular among celebrities!"

					"An anti-aging skincare treatment that provides an alternative to microdermabrasion and is a good choice for anyone who has facial hair or visible broken capillaries.",
					"This is a highly effective manual exfoliation technique that removes surface debris with a sterile, surgical scalpel (dermaplaning blade). An aesthetician uses the scalpel while holding the skin taut, swiping the blade in gentle upward motions to exfoliate the skin’s surface, removing the top-most layer of dead skin. The added bonus is the removal of the fine, vellus hair (aka peach fuzz), which makes the skin feel smoother. It does not cause trauma to the skin."
