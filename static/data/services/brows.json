					"Brow lamination is a relaxer that tames unruly and sparse brow hairs to lay where they should, creating a beautiful face-framing shape. It’s less expensive, less invasive, and a temporary alternative to microblading and ombre.",
					"<strong>What to know:</strong> This treatment will leave you with fluffy, custom-shaped brows. Do not wet brows for 24 hours. Do not exfoliate or use retinol, Vitamin A, AHAs, BHAs, steroid creams or skin thinning treatments around the eye/brow area for at least 48 hours post-treatment. A styling and nourishing product like Elleplex Advanced Aftercare will maintain your new look - ask your esthetician if you don’t have one at home."

					"Get those brows that wow! Shaping, tint, trim, and tweeze. You can flaunt natural, full-looking brows that create a polished & put-together look on every face! Ideal for people with light and fair colored eyebrows. Need a bolder everyday brow but looking to skip the long tedious task of filling them in on the daily? Tinting may be the perfect fit for you."

				"title": "Brow Shaping",

				"text": [
					"Recommended for first time clients. Includes brow shaping (wax, trim, tweeze, shape & fill). We will finish off your appointment by applying highlighter/concealer over your skin to eliminate the majority of any redness from the waxing. Interested in filling in your brows for a more polished look? Let us know, and we will take the time to go over the best products you can use for your brows."

					"Start them while they're young. Our waxing techniques are gentle on young skin and your teen will leave with full, natural & clean looking brows. For ages 16 and under. Visit us for some teen brow love (wax, trim, tweeze & shape). Lip wax & tint can be added on at the time of appointment (added cost)."
